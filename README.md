# Interactive 3D Story with Three.js

This project is a starting point for creating an interactive 3D story experience for kids using Three.js.

## Current Status

A basic Three.js scene has been set up:
- An `index.html` file serves as the entry point.
- The Three.js library is included via CDN.
- A `main.js` file contains the script to render a simple 3D scene.
- The scene currently displays a rotating green cube on a sky blue background.

## How to View

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports WebGL.

## Next Steps

The plan is to expand this basic setup to include:
- Story elements (characters, environments, props).
- Interactivity to allow users to progress through the story.
- Animations to bring the story to life.
